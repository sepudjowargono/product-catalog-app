# 🛍️ Ecommerce Web Product Catalog Shopping Cart App

## 📖 Overview

This project is a React-based product catalog and shopping cart application. The app uses the FakeStore API to display products, filter products by category, and allow users to add items to a shopping cart.

The shopping cart is managed using Redux Toolkit and is saved in `sessionStorage` so the cart data stays available while the browser session is active.

## ✨ Features

### 🛒 Product Catalog

- Displays a list of products from the FakeStore API
- Shows each product's:
  - 🏷️ Title
  - 💲 Price
  - 📂 Category
  - 📝 Description
  - ⭐ Rating
  - 🖼️ Image
- Includes an **Add to Cart** button for each product

#

### 🔎 Dynamic Category Filter

- Uses React Query to fetch product categories from the API
- The dropdown is dynamically generated and is not hard coded
- Users can filter products by category
- Selecting a category updates the displayed products

#

### 🧺 Shopping Cart

- Users can decrease product quantity from the cart, or remove products from the cart
- If a product quantity reaches zero, the item is automatically removed from the cart
- If the same product is added more than once, the quantity increases
- Cart displays:
  - 🏷️ Product title
  - 🖼️ Product image
  - 🔢 Quantity
  - 💲 Price
- Users can remove products from the cart

#

### 📊 Cart Totals

The cart automatically calculates and displays:

- 🛍️ Total number of products

#

### ✅ Checkout

- Checkout clears the cart from Redux state
- Checkout also clears the cart from `sessionStorage`
- A success message appears after checkout

#

### 🖼️ Image Fallback

Some FakeStore API images may fail to load. This app includes image fallback handling so a placeholder image appears if the original product image is unavailable.

#

### 🎨 Styling

- Modern beige and brown colour scheme
- Responsive product grid
- Sticky navigation bar
- Styled product cards and shopping cart section
- Hover effects for buttons and cards

## 📱 How to Use the App

### 👀 View Products

When the app loads, all products are displayed on the home page.

#

### 🔎 Filter by Category

Use the dropdown menu to select a category.

The product list will update based on the selected category.

#

### ➕ Add to Cart

Click the **Add to Cart** button on any product card.

The item will be added to the shopping cart.

If the item already exists in the cart, the quantity will increase.

#

### ➖ Remove from Cart

Click the **Remove** button beside a cart item to decrease its quantity.

If the quantity reaches zero, the item is automatically removed from the cart. 

#

### ✅ Checkout

Click the **Checkout** button to complete the simulated purchase.

This clears:

- Redux cart state
- `sessionStorage`

A success message will display after checkout.

---

## 🧠 State Management

### ⚡ React Query

React Query is used for API/server data, including:

- Products
- Categories
- Category-filtered products

React Query handles:

- Fetching
- Loading states
- Error states
- Caching

#

### 🧰 Redux Toolkit

Redux Toolkit is used for shopping cart state.

The cart state includes:

- Product information
- Quantity of each item
- Add/remove/clear cart actions

#

### 💾 sessionStorage

The cart is saved in `sessionStorage`.

This allows the cart to remain available during the browser session, even if the page is refreshed.

---

## ⚠️ Error Handling

The app includes error handling for:

- Failed product API requests
- Failed category API requests
- Broken product images
- `sessionStorage` loading and saving issues

---

## 🖼️ Image Fallback Handling

If a product image fails to load, the app replaces it with a placeholder image.

Example:

```tsx
onError={(e) => {
  e.currentTarget.src = PLACEHOLDER_IMAGE;
}}
```

This prevents broken images from appearing in the UI.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

Possible future updates could include:

- 🔢 Add quantity increase/decrease buttons
- 📄 Add a product details page
- 🔍 Add search functionality
- 🔐 Add login/authentication
- 🧾 Add order confirmation page
- 💾 Add localStorage option for longer cart persistence
- 📱 Improve mobile layout further
- ✨ Add animations or toast notifications
